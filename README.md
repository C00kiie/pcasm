#PC Assembly Language book

This repo contains the LaTeX source of my popular 32-bit 80x86 assembly
language book.

You need LaTeX installed with all extra packages. On Ubuntu, I needed to
install the *texlive-latex-base* and *texlive-latex-extra* packages.

To generate the PDF file, go to the latex/english directory and type:

> pdflatex pcasm

and type * at the \infiles= prompt. (You may have to repeat this to get
all the references resolved.)

I will also be adding the source code examples and the translations in 
the near future.
