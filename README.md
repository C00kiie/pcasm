# PC Assembly Language book

This repo contains the LaTeX source of my 32-bit 80x86 assembly
language book and the translations.

You need LaTeX installed with all extra packages to create the PDF
from these files. On Ubuntu, I needed to install the *texlive-latex-base* 
and *texlive-latex-extra* packages.

To generate the PDF file, go to the latex/english directory and type:

> pdflatex pcasm

and type * at the \infiles= prompt. (You may have to repeat this to get
all the references resolved.)
